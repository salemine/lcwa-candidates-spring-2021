              <p> Being a LCWA member for some 15 years now and being semi-retired, I am able to contribute back to the
                organization. I am interested in serving on the Board of Directors. </p>

              <p> I foresee new challenges to LCWA such as competition from new satellite ISPs and user energy concerns.
                The PNM grid is becoming less reliable and it may be prudent to examine the possibilities of offering
                solar powered end user systems. While LCWA reliability has increased over the years PNM appears to have
                increasing problems. </p>

              <p> With the rapid increase of online commerce, it is obvious that this will be a challenge to the
                Network. There is also the diminished use of satellite/cable TV and the increase of online TV
                programming challenge. </p>

              <p> My computer experiences began with a Commodore 64 in 1983 and I made the decision to go with Microsoft
                (right or wrong) rather than Apple. My main focus was to support my Visual Art career, not only with the
                business aspect, but also end user CAD/CAM. </p>

              <p> I am sure that there are many other areas that the Board must address. Thank you for your
                consideration. </p>
              </p>
