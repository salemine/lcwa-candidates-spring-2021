              <p class="card-text">
              <p> I have been a member of LCWA since 2007, and have served in a variety of capacities. I'm currently
                serving as President and as a member of the LCWA technical group. After retiring from a career that
                included work at NASA, the National Center for Atmospheric Research, Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, Los
                Alamos Scientific Laboratory, and with private companies involved in computer security and policy for
                various US Government agencies, I remain active in the community providing technical support to startups
                and several non-profit community-service organizations. My other interests include music and reading.
              </p>

              <p>
                LCWA has undergone major transitions in our technical and administrative operations over the past
                several years in order to accommodate changes in the nature and size of our membership. The need for
                volunteers with a wide variety of talents and capabilities has never been greater. We face a number of
                challenges and opportunities over the next 2-3 years as government and private interest, funding and
                support for rural internet service is increasing as never before. Rapidly expanding and evolving
                internet use by home systems for entertainment, communications, and security is straining our technology
                and capacity in new ways.
                If elected I will work to significantly expand member involvement in planning for the future, in
                designing and implementing technical solutions to our challenges, and in seeking private and public
                sources of funding and technical support to implement these solutions. </p>
